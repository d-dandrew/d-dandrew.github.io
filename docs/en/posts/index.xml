      <description>Enable katex by adding katex = &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; to the front matter
+++ katex = &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; +++ It&amp;rsquo;s almost a dropin alternative to the mathjax solution,you should just choose one of them.
Inline math looks like this
This is text with inline math $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} =1$ This is text with inline math $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1$
and with math blocks:
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} =1$$ $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1 $$
This is using [ ] \\( \\) code delimiters</description>

      <description>Arthur C. Clarke It is three thousand light-years to the Vatican. Once, I believed that space could have no power over faith, just as I believed that the heavens declared the glory of God&amp;rsquo;s handiwork. Now I have seen that handiwork, and my faith is sorely troubled. I stare at the crucifix that hangs on the cabin above the Mark VI Computer, and for the first time in my life I wonder if it is no more than an empty symbol.</description>

      <description>The Last Question By Isaac Asimov Arthur Isaac Asimov
This is by far my favorite story of all those I have written.
After all, I undertook to tell several trillion years of human history in the space of a short story and I leave it to you as to how well I succeeded. I also undertook another task, but I won&#39;t tell you what that was lest l spoil the story for you.</description>
